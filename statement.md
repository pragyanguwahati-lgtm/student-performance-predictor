# Problem Statement


Many students and instructors want a quick way to estimate the likelihood that a student will pass a course based on a few measurable factors (study hours, attendance, prior performance). This project builds a simple classifier to predict pass/fail status and demonstrates core ML concepts.


## Scope
- Input: CSV dataset with features: study_hours, attendance_pct, prev_grade, sleep_hours, extra_help
- Output: `Pass` or `Fail` prediction and probability score.
- Deliverables: source code, README.md, statement.md, project report (PDF)


## Target users
- Students learning basics of ML
- Instructors wanting a demo for classroom use


## High-level features
- Data generation and ingestion
- Preprocessing pipeline
- Model training and persistence
- Evaluation and reporting
- CLI for inference
